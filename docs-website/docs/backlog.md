# Backlog

## Top QOL priorities

- iso overload in files

## V2 release

- network error handling
- components and "realized" resolvers, as well as ways to invalidate them
  - they could also be lazily calculated
  - may require garbage collection
- cleanup types
- error handling
- validate no unknown directives left over
- exposeAs as param
  - use serde for this?
- Handle unions etc. correctly
- Special fields (or syntax?) for type casts (i.e. type refinement)

## Feature backlog

- garbage collection
- granular re-rendering
  - Refetch on missing data
- fetch policies
- Unwraps (i.e. `!`) exist in the syntax, but are unused
  - consider whether it is truly the case that there always is a linear way to unwrap a given field, or whether we should unify this with "execute this on the server" etc.
- Resolvers are re-calculated every time. They should be cached in the store.
- Resolvers return opaque objects and cannot be selected into. They should be extended to also allow the return of IDs, which can then be selected into.
- Stateful resolvers?
  - This could be thought of as "realized" resolvers, which is to say there is overlap with better DevEx for components
- Subscriptions are not supported
- Defer, etc.
- Pagination.
- Types for variables
- typed IDs
- consider resolvers that return functions only read data when called, i.e. do not eagerly read. Consider whether this can be achieved with omitting a !, i.e. foo_resolver! returns TReadFromStore, foo_resolver returns a `ReadDataResult TReadFromStore`
- refetch and mutation fields should return something you can suspend on or whatnot.
- queries in flight as store fields for suspense

## Cleanup backlog

- only generate resolvers if they're reachable. Maybe warn if user-created resolvers are not reachable.
- Typegen code is a mess
  - Rename ResolverParameterType to TypeNameFieldNameParameter or something
- JS code needs structure, etc.
- `HACK__merge_linked_fields` is indicative of the fact that merged linked fields should contain hashmaps of key => merged item, instead of vectors of merged items.
- Objects which do not have IDs should be merged into their parent object in the store.
  - or weak types are scalars
- IsographSchemaObject, etc. should not contain name: `WithLocation<...>`, but instead, be stored `WithLocation T`, and WithLocation should **not** have a span.
- There should be a cleaner separation between GraphQL and Isograph. In particular, we should load the GraphQL schema, but turn it into Isograph concepts, and only deal with Isograph concepts.
- CLI should be separate crate than batch-compile; so should watch mode utils, so as to increase the speed of iteration if the dev is running builds.
- CLI command to create missing directories (e.g. project_root).
- do not panic when an unknown token is encountered

## Known bugs

- If a useLazyReference commits then receives new props, it does not make a new network request.
- if mutation primary field has a non-existent type, we panic, this should be an error
  - this is because we add the fields before we call Schema::validate_and_construct, where the error would naturally be found.
  - e.g. change it to

```graphql
type SetBestFriendResponse {
  pet: PetFoo!
}
```

- error parsing config should not panic, but be a diagnostic

## Extended backlog

- Docs
- VSCode extension
- Fetch policies
- Garbage collection
- Preloaded queries
- Fetch/cache policies
- Granular re-renders
- Ability to select fewer or extra fields on mutation and refetch fields, e.g.

```
# Disallow +/- if = is used
# maybe = is implied
set_foo +{
  additional_field
} -{
  extraneous_field
} ={
  only_field
}

# or its on the field level
set_foo {
  +additional_field
  -extraneous_field
  -* # clear all fields
}
```
